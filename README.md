# Mandelbrot fractal explorer

This is a simple Mandelbrot fractal explorer written in V.  

It uses v mandelbrot example base code which can be found [here](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/examples/gg/mandelbrot.v).  

Coloring part is achieved by using linear interpolation on a color palette.  

There is a palette generator, it juste add steps to a color list so the fractal is colored with a gradient.  
Will soon use it in the main program to clear the constant.v file that is awfull.

## Requirements

- [V](https://github.com/vlang/v)

## Usage

```bash
v run .
```

Or

```bash
v . -o something.exe
./something.exe
```

## Museum

Here are some images generated by the program, there are many more in the `museum` folder.

## TODO

- [x] Implement smooth coloring. 

- [x] Translate palette generator from Python to V.

- [x] Add possibility to change the color palette without restarting and modifying a const

- [ ] Fix zooming (Work well until a certain point, then it starts to glitch).

- [ ] Add GPU support, program is very slow on cpu (I'm not sure if it's possible to do it in V actually).

- [ ] Add direct image saving, generated images in the museum folder are just screenshots.

- [x] Create other generators, like Julia sets, burning ship or newton fractals.  
  (julia, mandelbrot and burning ship done actually)

- [ ] Remove all the palettes from constants and just call the palette generator at the start to create one  
      And possibly recall it with other rgb codes to change in real time

- [ ] Try other coloring methods, like HSV, LCH, etc.. which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set).
